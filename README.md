### Project Overview

This project implements a simple 16-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) processor in Verilog. The processor is designed for educational purposes, providing a platform for understanding the basic concepts of processor design, instruction sets, and digital logic.

The processor includes a small set of instructions, a control unit, and a datapath capable of executing basic arithmetic, logic, and memory operations. It can be simulated using Verilog HDL simulators, making it suitable for use in coursework, research, or as a starting point for more complex designs.

---

### Features

- **16-bit Architecture**: The processor operates on 16-bit data and addresses.
- **Basic Instruction Set**: Supports load/store, arithmetic, logic, branch, and jump instructions.
- **Modular Design**: The processor is implemented in a modular fashion, making it easy to extend or modify.
- **Testbench Included**: A testbench is provided to simulate and verify the functionality of the processor.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- **Verilog HDL Simulator**: Ensure you have a Verilog HDL simulator installed (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).
- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository.

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akor-Michael/RISC-Processor-16-Bit
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd risc-processor
   ```

3. **Open the Project**: Use your preferred Verilog HDL simulator to open the project files.

---

### Usage

1. **Compile the Processor**:
   - Open the Verilog source files in your simulator and compile them.

2. **Run the Testbench**:
   - Open `test_Risc_16_bit.v` in your simulator.
   - Run the simulation to verify the processor's functionality.

3. **Analyze the Output**:
   - Use waveform viewers or console outputs to analyze the behavior of the processor and ensure it operates as expected.

4. **Modify and Extend**:
   - You can modify the processor's design or add new instructions by editing the appropriate Verilog files.
